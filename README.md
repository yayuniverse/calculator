# Calculator

This web application is a simple yet stylish calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. Here's what it does:

1. Provides a user-friendly interface for mathematical calculations
2. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
3. Allows input of decimal numbers
4. Displays the calculation result in real-time
5. Features a clear button to reset the calculation
6. Includes an info button for additional information (functionality to be implemented)

The calculator is designed with a modern, minimalist aesthetic, featuring:

- A dark background for reduced eye strain
- Colorful operator buttons for easy identification
- A blurred, semi-transparent display field for a sleek look
- A looping animation of mathematical operators for visual interest

This project demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, making it a great example of front-end web development basics.
